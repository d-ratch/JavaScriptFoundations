    <h2>The four types of logical operators</h2>
        <p>
            There are four logical operators in JavaScript: || (OR), && (AND), ! (NOT), ?? (Nullish Coalescing)
            <p>
                Although they are called "logical", they can be applied to values of any type, not only boolean. Their result can be any type as well.
            </p>
        </p>
        
        

    <h2>|| OR ||</h2>
        <p>
            The "OR" operator is represented with two vertical line symbols:
                <script>
                    result = a || b;
                </script>
                    <p>
                        In classical programmingm the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only. If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.
                            <p>
                                In JavaScript, the operator is a bit trickier and more powerful. First, what happens with Booleans?
                                    <h4>There are four logical combinatiosd</h4>
                                        <script>
                                            console.log(true || true); // true
                                            console.log(false || true); // true
                                            console.log(true || false); // true
                                            console.log(false || false); // falsed
                                        </script>
                                            <p>
                                                As we can see, the result is always true unless both operands are false
                                                    <p>
                                                        If an operand is not a boolean, it's converted to a boolean for evaluation.
                                                            <p>
                                                                For instance, the number 1 is treat as true and the number 0 is treated as false"
                                                                    <script>
                                                                        if ( 1 || 0) {
                                                                            // alert( 'truthy!' ); 
                                                                        }
                                                                    </script>
                                                                        <p>
                                                                            Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any given condition is true.
                                                                                <h4>For Example:</h4>

                                                                                                    let isWeekend = true;
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    if (hour1 < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) {

                                            </p>

    <h3>OR || finds the first truthy value</h3>
        <p>
            The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let's bring in the 'extra' features of JavaScript
                <p>
                    The extended algorithm works as follows:
                        <p>
                            given multiple OR'd values:
                                <script>
                                    result1 = value1 || value2 || value3;
                                </script>

                                    <p>
                                        The OR || operator does the following:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Evaluates operands from left to right</li>
                                                <li>For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.</li>
                                                <li>If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                                <p>
                                                    A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.
                                                    In other words, a chain of || OR returns the first truthy value of the last one if no truthy value is found.
                                                        <h4>For Instance:</h4>
                                                            <script>
                                                                console.log(1 || 0); //1 (1 is truthy)

                                                                console.log(null || 1); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
                                                                console.log(null || 0 || 1); // 1 (the first truthy value)

                                                                console.log(udefined || null || 0) // 0 (all falsy returns the last value)
                                                            </script>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    This leads to some interesting usage compared to a "pure, classical, boolean-only OR"
                                                                </p>
                                                                    <h4>1. Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions</h4>
                                                                        <p>
                                                                            For instance, we have firstName, lastName, and nickName variables, all optional (i.e. can be undefined or have falsy values)
                                                                        </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                Let's use OR || to choose the one that has the data and show it (or "Anonymous" if nothing is set)
                                                                                    <script>
                                                                                        let firstName = "";
                                                                                        let lastName = "";
                                                                                        let nickName = "Dewey.B";

                                                                                        console.log(firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // Dewey.B
                                                                                    </script>
                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                            If all variables were falsy, "Anonymous" shows up.
                                                                                        </p>
                                                                            </p>

                                                        <h4>2. Short-circuit evaluation</h4>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                Another feature of the OR || operator is the so-called "short-circuit" evaluation.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                                <p>
                                                                                    It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the argument.
                                                                                </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                        The importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn't juast a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment or a function call. In the example below, the second message is printed, but not the first.
                                                                                            <script>
                                                                                                true || console.log("Not printed");
                                                                                                false || console.log("Printed");
                                                                                            </script>
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                            In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the alert isn't run.
                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition of the part is falsy.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                        
                                                                                
                                                </p>

    <h2>&& AND &&</h2>
        <p>
            The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:
                <script>
                    results = a && b;
                </script>
        </p>
            <p>
                In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise:
                    <script>
                        console.log(true && false); // true
                        console.log(false && true); // false
                        console.log(true && false) // false
                        console.log(false && false) // false
                    </script>
            </p>
                <p>
                    An example with if:
                        <script>
                            let hour2 = 12;
                            let minute = 30;

                            if (hour == 12 && minute == 30) {
                                console.log('The time is 12:30');
                            }
                        </script>
                </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:
                            <script>
                                if (1 && 0) {
                                    console.log("Won't work, because the result is falsy" );
                                }
                            </script>
                    </p>
                        <p>
                            <h4>AND "&&" finds the first falsy value</h4>
                        
                            given multiple AND'd values:
                                <script>
                                    result2 = value1 && value2 && value3;
                                </script>
                        </p>
                            <p>
                                The AND && operator does the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Evaluates operands from left to right</li>
                                        <li>For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.</li>
                                        <li>If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </p>
                                <p>
                                    In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.
                                </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value, while OR returns the first truthy value.
                                            <h4>Examples:</h4>
                                                <script>
                                                    // if the first operand is truthy,
                                                    // AND returns the second operand:
                                                    console.log(1 && 0); // 0
                                                    cnsole.log(1 && 5); // 5

                                                    // if the first operand is falsy,
                                                    // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored.
                                                    console.log(null && 5); // null
                                                    console.log(0 && "No matter what"); // 0
                                                </script>
                                    </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first one is returned:
                                                <script>
                                                    console.log(1 && 2 && null && 3); // null
                                                </script>
                                        </p>
                                            <p>
                                                When all the values are truthy, the value is returned:
                                                    <script>
                                                        console.log(1 && 2 && 3); // 3
                                                    </script>
                                            </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Precedence of AND && is higher than OR ||
                                                </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Therefore, the code (a && b || c && d) is essentially the same as if the && expressions were in parenthesses: (a && b) || (c && d);
                                                    </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Don't replace if with || or &&

                                                                Sometimes, people use the && operator as a "shorter way to write if".

                                                                        <script>
                                                                            let x = 1;

                                                                        </script>
                                                                    </p>
                                                                        <p>

                                                                        </p>

                                                                                So use every construct for its purpose: use "if" if we want if and use && if we want AND.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                                                              
    <h2>! NOT !</h2>
        <p>
            The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign "!"
                <p>
                    The syntax is pretty simple:
                        <script>
                            result3 = !value;
                        </script>
                            <p>
                                The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Converts the operand and boolean type: true/false</li>
                                        <li>Returns the inverse value</li>
                                    </ol>
                                        <p>
                                            For instance: 
                                                <script>
                                                    console.log(!true); //false 
                                                </script>
                                                    <p>
                                                        A double NOT  !! is sometimes used for converting a value to a boolean type:
                                                            <script>
                                                                console.log(!!"non-empty string"); // true
                                                                console.log(!!null); // false
                                                            </script>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    That is, the first NOT converts the value to a boolean an returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain value-to-boolean conversion.
                                                                        <p>
                                                                            There's a little more verbose way to do the same thing - a built-in Boolean function:
                                                                                <script>
                                                                                    console.log(Boolean("Non-empty string")); true
                                                                                    console.log(Boolean(null)); // false
                                                                                </script>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                        The precedence of ! NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before && or ||
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                        </p>
                                                                </p>
                                                    </p>
                                        </p>
                            </p>
                </p>
        </p>

            <script>
                let age = 19;

                if (age >= 19 && age <= 90) {
                    console.log("The age is greater than 19 but less than 90");
                } else if (age < 19 || age > 90) {
                    console.log("You're either too young or too old.");
                } else if (!(age >= 19 && age <= 90)) {
                    console.log("You're either too young or too old.");

        <p>
            My first attempt:
            <script>
                let login = "";
                let password = "";

                if (login == "Admin") {
                    console.log("Enter Password")
                } else if (login == !("Admin")) {
                    console.log("I don't know you!")
                } else if (login == "" || null) {
                    console.log("Whatchya doin' here boyo?")
                }

                if (password == "TheMaster") {
                    console.log("Welcome!")
                } else if (password == !("TheMaster")) {
                    console.log("Wrong Password")
                } else if (password == null || "") {
                    console.log("I don't know you!")
                } else {
                    console.log("What are you doing here?")
                }

            </script>
        </p>

        <p>
            The solution: 
                <script>
                    let userName = prompt("Who's there?", '');

                    if (userName === 'Admin') {
                        let pass = prompt('Password?', '');

                            if (pass === 'The Master') {
                                console.log('Welcome!'); 
                            } else if (pass === '' || pass === null) {
                                console.log('Canceled');
                            } else {
                                console.log('Wrong Password');
                            }
                            
                    } else if (userName === '' || userName === null) {
                        console.log('Canceled');
                    } else {
                        console.log("I don't know you!")
                    }
                </script>
