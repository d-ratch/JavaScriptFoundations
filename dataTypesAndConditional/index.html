        <h1>Making Decisions in your code - Conditionals</h1> 

            <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>
                    In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if a player has 0 lives, then it's game over. 
                    In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it's nighttime.
                </p>


            <h2>You can have it on one condition!</h2> 
                <p>
                    Human beings (and other animals) make decisions that affect their lives all the time. Whether it's small, "should I eat one cookie or two?" (obviously two..), to large, "Should I stay in Lexington MO and hate myself as PIC or move across the country, work at Dartmouth, and learn to code to create a unique career opportunity?"
                    <p>
                        Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two?"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie", might be "still feel hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)
                    </p>
                </p>
            
            
            <h2>If...else statements</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's look at the most common type of conditional you'll use in JavaScript - the humble if...else statement.
                        <h3>Basic if...else syntax</h3>
                            <p>
                                Basic if...else syntax looks like this:
                                <script>
                                    if (condition) {
                                        /* code to run if the condition is true */
                                    } else {
                                        /* run other code if condition is false */
                                    }
                                </script>
                                    <p>
                                        <h4>Here we've got:</h4>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>The keyword if followed by parentheses.</li>
                                                <li>A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is the value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist"?) The condition makes use of comparison operators.</li>
                                                <li>A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code - this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns true</li>
                                                <li>The keyword else</li>
                                                <li>Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code - this can be any code we like, and only runs if the condition is not true  -  or in other words, the condition is false</li>
                                            </ol>
                                                <p>
                                                    This code is pretty human-readable - it's saying "if the condition returns true, run code A, else run code B"
                                                </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        You should note that you don't have to include the else and the second curly brace block - the following is perfectly legal"
                                                            <script>
                                                                if (condition) {
                                                                    /* code to run if the condition is true */
                                                                }

                                                                /* run some other code */
                                                            </script>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    However, you need to be careful here - in this case, the second block of code is not controlled by the conditioanl statement, so it always runs, regardless of whether or not the condition is true or false.
                                                                    This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it might not be what you want - often you want to run one block of code or the other, not both.
                                                                </p>
                                                                    <h3>A real example:</h3>   
                                                                        <p>
                                                                            <script>
                                                                                let shoppingDone = false;
                                                                                let childsAllowance;

                                                                                if (shoppingDone === true) {
                                                                                    childsAllowance = 10;
                                                                                } else {
                                                                                    childsAllowance = 5;
                                                                                }
                                                                            </script>
                                                                            This code as shown always results in the shoppingDone value returning false, meaning disappointment for our poor child. It'd be up to us to provide the mechanism for the parent to set the shoppingDone variable to true if the child did the shopping.
                                                                        </p>
                                                    </p>
                                    </p>
                            </p>
                </p>


            <h2>else if</h2>
                <p>
                    The last example provided us with two choices, or outcomes - but what if we want more than two?
                </p>     
                    <p>
                        There is a way to chain on extra choices/outcomes to your if...else - using else if.
                        Each extra choice requires an additonal block to put in between if () { } and else { } - check out the following more involved example, 
                        which could be a part of a simple weather forecast application:
                        <div>
                            <label for="weather">Select the weather type today:</label>
                            <select id ="weather">
                                <option value="">--Make a choice--</option>
                                <option value='sunny'>Sunny</option>
                                <option value='rainy'>Rainy</option>
                                <option value='snowing'>Snowing</option>
                                <option value='overcast'>Overcast</option>
                            </select>

                            <section></section>
                        </div>
                            <script>
                                const select = document.querySelector("select");
                                const para = document.querySelector("section");

                                select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

                                function setWeather() {
                                    const choice = select.value;

                                    if (choice === 'sunny') {
                                        para.textContent = 
                                            "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or park and get an ice cream!";
                                    } else if (choice === 'rainy') {
                                        para.textContent =
                                            "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
                                    } else if (choice === 'snowing') {
                                        para.textContent = 
                                            "The snow is coming down - it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
                                    } else if (choice === 'overcast') {
                                        "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
                                    } else {
                                        para.textContent = '';
                                    }
                                }
                            </script>
                            <p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Here we've got an HTML <select> element allowing us to make different weather choices, and a simple paragraph.</li>
                                    <li>In the JavaScript, we are storing a reference to both the <select> and <p> elements, and adding an event listener to the "select" element so that when its value is changed, the setWeather() function is run.</li>
                                    <li>When this function is run, we first set a variable called choice to the current value selected in the "select" element.
                                        We then use a conditional statment to show different text inside the paragraph depending on what the value of choice is.
                                        Notice how all the conditions are tested in else if () { } blocks, except the first one, which is tested in an if { } block.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The very last choice, is the else { } block, is basically a "last resort" option - the code inside it will be run if none of the conditions are true. In this case, it serves to empty the text out of the paragraph if nothing is selected, for example, if a user decides to re-select the "--Make a choice--" placeholder option shown at the beginning.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                    </p>


                <h2>A note on comparison operators</h2>
                    <p>
                        Comparison operators are used to test the conditions inside our conditional statements.
                        Our choices are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>"===" and "!==" - Test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.</li>
                                <li>"<" and ">" - Test if one value is less than or greater than another.</li>
                                <li>"<=" and ">=" - Test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.</li>
                            </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Make note of testing boolean (true/false) values, a common pattern you'll come across. 
                                    Any value that is not false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or any empty string('') actually returns true when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can use a variable name on its own to test whether it is true, or even that it exists (that is, it is not undefined.)
                                    So for example:
                                        <script>
                                            let cheese = 'Cheddar';

                                            if (cheese) {
                                                console.log("Yay! Cheese available for making cheese on toast!");
                                            } else {
                                                console.log('No cheese on toast for you today :()');
                                            }
                                        </script>
                                            <p>
                                                Furthermore, if we return to the chore example above:
                                                    <script>
                                                        // We don't need to explicitly specify 'shoppingDone === true'
                                                        if (shoppingDone) {
